## Analysis

This project aimed to reproduce AirBNB using Javascript on the front and backends. This was our first exposure to Node, and we decided to forgo using Express for an added challenge.

I wrote about the technical side of this project [here](http://TomStuart92.github.io/Node)

The slower development cycle of working in a new language and environment, means this project didn't quite get finished to the standard I'd like. There are still features that need to be implemented, and the visual finish could use some polish.

However the experience I gained in using Node here has been invaluable moving forward into some of the more complicated builds later on the course. For example, the back-end of our final project was built entirely in Node. You can read about it [here](http://tomstuart92.github.io/portfolio/Attendr/).
